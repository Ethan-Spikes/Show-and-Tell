# Show-and-Tell
a repository of code (or other things maybe) to show things I know how to do (or knew at some point, I sometimes forget)

The difference between this repository and other ones is that this one is specifically for proving that I have some desired skill, while the other ones I have are usually for creating functional scripts.
